## May 15

**W** Transient dynamics
I need to assess what I should do next about the paper. For now, I should work on the figure and add what is missing to the text. It is not clear to me in which order should I explain things so that everything makes sense.

So I should first present the general approach. No doubts about that, apparentely. Then I should move to the error. And then to the specific equations for the Lotka-Volterra.
I am not sure how to represent the error.
The error calculation is based on the triangular inequality.

I don't like very much the idea of putting this equations in the main text, but it is good for now. I should say that we consider relevant processess those whose weights are larger or equal than one. Then mention that the error is bounded.

I don't know how to write the error. Should I use weights or As

Remove error from methods.


## May 16

I have been doing the stability analysis for half of the existing dynamics (8). That includes calculating equilibrium and type of stability.
Also, I started the registration process for conferences in Spain in june.

Tomorrow:
-Finish stability analysis
-Correct figure for the subsampling paper.
-Start reading microbialization/viralization paper.
-Derivation of the error.
