## May 8
The main goals I can think of for this week would be:
    -Re-do figure 4.
    -Put together a file for the parameters of the simulations.
    -Re-assess all things that need to be fixed in the main text.

I should work on the subsampling paper as well, but I need to reassess my goals.
Open GoldSim for a little while.
Keep reading transient dynamics to look for specific references

Figure 4 has been redone. Refs corrected.
Reference style corrected.
Things to do:
-Error formula: try something before messaging Toni
-Fix supplementary materials File 1
-Fill up table with equilibria
-Fix supplementary materials figures.


## May 9

I am going to go for the next figure for the subaquatic sampling paper today. How am I going to do this figure? So what I want to plot is Ds vs Di(t=0). I want to do this because the goal would be to get the density of interest given the density of the sample. However, there are different parameters there: time and sampling flow rate, particularly.
I can put the density of the environment $D_I$ as a function of $D_S$ as:

$$D_I=D_E - \frac{vt(D_S - D_I)}{V_I(\exp{\frac{-vt}{V_I}} - 1)$$

How do I code this now? I want to set specific time values and flow rates. I should do this with the same structure I was using.

I think once I have my function I can do whatever I want with it.
I have plotted Di as a function of Ds for a fixed interval time and different flow rates, but I am not satisfied with the results. Different flow rates produce different sample densities. Should I fix the sample density and play around with time points instead? But how would I do that exactly? I need to keep thinking about it.

Tomorrow:
 Prepare a template for the conference with Jenna.
 Take a look at the eDAR function
 What is missing in the modular model?
 What are the parameters?
 What does Jenna need to be done?

After the meeting, think about the figure for the subsampling paper.

Do the error analysis: do the derivation on your own, copy-paste formula on paper (even if it is wrong). Once you finish, translate that to latex.

I don't know whic formula I should put for the error: a general one or one tailored to the specific problem.

Tomorrow:
-Make sure error formula in the main text makes sense.
-Print and review text.
-Revise supplementary derivation of error estimate.
-Finish derivation of the PerCapFinit
-Upload new version
-Supplementary figures

## May 11

-Figure 1a (check picture) - done
-Add L-V equation to 1b - done
-Put first paragraph in results: cite Figure 1a. And add general formalism.
$$\frac{\tau}{A_i}{dA_i}{dt}=\omega_{1} +$$
-Add error. Error is bounded.
-Remove error equation and reference it.
-Equilibrium and stability analysis. If unstable, look at the attractor. If $\lamda_1$ positive and $\lambda_2$ negative, write attractor. If one $\lambda$=0, it does not change. Add a column explaining type of equilibrium.
-Put parentheses on references. - done
-Put VII affiliation in Matt's name. - done
-Make figure 3 larger. - done
-Figure 6 conceptual. Panel a. Phase diagram.
-Another iteration of Grammarly: abstract and introduction.

-Ask Forest if meeting is possible.
-Cover letter.
-Think of reviewers.

I need to write a first draft of an abstract. What can I add to the original abstract that helps me?
