## May 22

I want to work on the abstract for the conferences. I need to add words but I don't know exactly how and where.

I am going to read the abstract.

The only place where I think I could add something new is the explanation of percapfinit. Now, what could I add to that exactly?

**M** Meeting with Toni

Mail Roger y Marta:
     -Introduction Toni
     -Se tienen leer abstract, introduction, Results (percapfinit, case study, . Creen que esto es relevante? Lo habeis visto antes?
     -Si quieren, podemos hacer una videollamada.
     
Things to do:
       -Phase diagram No-No: P<Pc, B<Bc and P<Pc, B>Bc
       -Phase diagram yes-yes: cross thresholds.
       -Get rid of the first person.
       -Reduce to 5000 (try 4000).
       -Abstract: Explicitly mention that there are 16 dynamical regimes.
       -Cover letter:
       	      1. Es importante predecir cambios en las dinamicas.
	      2. Por que coges un sistema tan sencillo? Nuestro framework indica que, en un sistema dinamico, los procesos pueden estar activos o inactivos. Eso hace que tengas 16 dinamicas en nuestro caso. Como ya tienes tantas dinamicas, mejor que cojas un sistema pequenyo.
	      3. Escoger reviewers: mirar papers de Cairns, Jon Norberg, Rob Phillips, Alan Perelson, Kim Sneppen
       -Review de papers (punto 5 de Forest):
       -Review the paper: send to Roger and Marta and ask them for specific feedback items.
       -Use wourdcounter to count words.
       -Use grammarly to edit text.
       -Goal: 4000 words. Aim at reducing 600 in a first iteration:
       	      1. Paragraph: Is there any paragraph that can go out?
	      2. Sentence: Is there any sentence that con go out?
	      3. Words.
       -Then go for 5000 words.

-How to get rid of "we": Write a passive sentence to find an active element. Then write in active style with that element you have identified. Active element: 'the code', 'the figure', 'the results'...

Literature Review:
Think of what your approach does that the papers claim or do.
Cite them
Think of reviewers
Try to include things in the discussion.

Keywords: transient dynamics, tipping points, resilience.

Reviewers:
1. Applied math researcher: Strogatz, Alan Perelson
2. Theoretical biologists (Eco/Evo): Hastings, Weitz (?), Bruce Levin, Koonin (collaborators of him that do models)
3. Theoretical Biophysicist: Scheffer, Ricard Sole, Turchin, Jordi Bascompte, Rob Phillips.
