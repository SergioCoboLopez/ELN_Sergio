## May 8
The main goals I can think of for this week would be:
    -Re-do figure 4.
    -Put together a file for the parameters of the simulations.
    -Re-assess all things that need to be fixed in the main text.

I should work on the subsampling paper as well, but I need to reassess my goals.
Open GoldSim for a little while.
Keep reading transient dynamics to look for specific references

Figure 4 has been redone. Refs corrected.
Reference style corrected.
Things to do:
-Error formula: try something before messaging T
-Fix supplementary materials File 1
-Fill up table with equilibria
-Fix supplementary materials figures.
