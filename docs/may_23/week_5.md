## May 31
Things to focus on today and tomorrow:
1. Figure1
2. PerCapFiniT results section
3. Introduction/alternative frameworks (reviewers, general terms)
4. Remove wording
5. I would also draft a cover letter of some sort.

Where could I start?
I should read the remaining paper of the review in some detail to decide what is important about it. And how I would solve things with PerCapFiniT.
Then I should assess comments on the paper that I still have.
The next thing that bothers me is the introduction and results section. I should identify what exactly I should do about that. Which sentences or content I should include to make it acceptable.

**R** Minimal models of top-down control of phytoplankton

Using top-down control of phytoplankton to reduce turbidity of water in eutrophic lakes.
Daphnia produce a significant decrease in clorophyll. They eat algae. Many different species. They are generalists but very efficient (this is not common in nature)
I would say they want to use daphnia to go from one alternative stable state to another one (turbid to clear) and propose different models.
Daphnia can be killed or face limitations: for instance, clay particles. Other problems: hard to fight against cyanobacteria and fish like eating them.
The paradox of enrichment. The model does not predict what happens in the actual world systems.


**W** Transient dynamics. I added references and corrected small things. The next step should be to actually read it with expectations in mind and taking actual notes of what should be done and how.
In the meantime, I should look at the word count.

What do I have to say about transient dynamics here?

Three ideas:
1. Define transient dynamics
2. Specify what is difficult to predict.
3. Add a final sentence to 2nd paragraph to add all the things I have been reviewing.

## June 1
I will submit a milestone version before starting removing chunks of text. Maybe I should consider upon a deep read what to remove to get to a minimal version.
Also consider removing first person formulations.
