## May 22

I want to work on the abstract for the conferences. I need to add words but I don't know exactly how and where.

I am going to read the abstract.

The only place where I think I could add something new is the explanation of percapfinit. Now, what could I add to that exactly?

**M** Meeting with Toni

Mail Roger y Marta:
     -Introduction Toni
     -Se tienen leer abstract, introduction, Results (percapfinit, case study, . Creen que esto es relevante? Lo habeis visto antes?
     -Si quieren, podemos hacer una videollamada.
     
Things to do:
       -Phase diagram No-No: P<Pc, B<Bc and P<Pc, B>Bc
       -Phase diagram yes-yes: cross thresholds.
       -Get rid of the first person.
       -Reduce to 5000 (try 4000).
       -Abstract: Explicitly mention that there are 16 dynamical regimes.
       -Cover letter:
       	      1. Es importante predecir cambios en las dinamicas.
	      2. Por que coges un sistema tan sencillo? Nuestro framework indica que, en un sistema dinamico, los procesos pueden estar activos o inactivos. Eso hace que tengas 16 dinamicas en nuestro caso. Como ya tienes tantas dinamicas, mejor que cojas un sistema pequenyo.
	      3. Escoger reviewers: mirar papers de Cairns, Jon Norberg, Rob Phillips, Alan Perelson, Kim Sneppen
       -Review de papers (punto 5 de Forest):
       -Review the paper: send to Roger and Marta and ask them for specific feedback items.
       -Use wourdcounter to count words.
       -Use grammarly to edit text.
       -Goal: 4000 words. Aim at reducing 600 in a first iteration:
       	      1. Paragraph: Is there any paragraph that can go out?
	      2. Sentence: Is there any sentence that con go out?
	      3. Words.
       -Then go for 5000 words.

-How to get rid of "we": Write a passive sentence to find an active element. Then write in active style with that element you have identified. Active element: 'the code', 'the figure', 'the results'...

Literature Review:
Think of what your approach does that the papers claim or do.
Cite them
Think of reviewers
Try to include things in the discussion.

Keywords: transient dynamics, tipping points, resilience.

Reviewers:
1. Applied math researcher: Strogatz, Alan Perelson
2. Theoretical biologists (Eco/Evo): Hastings, Weitz (?), Bruce Levin, Koonin (collaborators of him that do models)
3. Theoretical Biophysicist: Scheffer, Ricard Sole, Turchin, Jordi Bascompte, Rob Phillips.

## May 23

I am going to assess the things I should do about the paper and the abstracts for the conferences. I will start taking notes on the draft from yesterday.
Then I should read the papers Toni sent me.
And I should reserve some time for the abstracts.

Text:
Introduction, 1st paragraph -  remove sentence - done
At the end of the first paragraph I have confusing notes and I don't know exactly what I am supposed to correct. I think several things:
1. Toni suggested one of the sentences should go to the third paragraph.
2. He said it would be better to highlight simply that it is very difficult to study transient dynamics because of a number of reasons.
3. He also suggested this could be an opportunity to introduce keywords (tipping points, for instance) and references (probably new ones).
4. He mentioned that the first sentence of the second paragraph could go at the end of the first paragraph. - done

Introduction 2nd paragraph
References to complement Strogatz (fast-slow dynamics)

Introduction, 3rd paragraph
1. Remove some first person
2. Try first sentence from the first paragraph.
3. A few typos or changes in sentences.
4. Remove Turchin reference - done


Change active or activated instead of 'relevant'



Results
Add titles for subsections
1st section
    Discuss the figure in the first place
    Change equations in deduction
    Change discussion about processes being active or not
    Discuss errors and orders (I don't know how)
    Clarify that you are staying on first order
    
change X%


I am going to look at the first reference now. What should I specifically look for here?
1. Keywords
2. Other approaches?
3. References

Idea: Take the first part of the sentence to the third paragraph and leave the rest as it is for now.

First paper to read:
1st paragraph: Regime shifts happen when a tipping point is passed. It is important to predict them because they have serious consequences.
2nd paragraph: There are statistical methods to identify regime shifts (his thesis). Autocorrelations in time series.
3rd paragraph: He did a field experiment manipulating lake ecosystems to see if they could identify tipping points.
4th paragraph: Description of the system (competitive trophic triangle)
5th paragraph: Description of the experiment (control and experimental lake, addition of predators)
6th paragraph: They detected warning signals of tipping point (novelty)
7th paragraph: The novelty was the use of heteroskadasticity

They did find a tool to predict regime shifts. And that is important and should be credited. Do I want to know what heteroskadasticity means in some detail? Maybe but not know.

From what I read today, I get the conclusion that there is at least one tool to predict transient dynamics or regime shifts at least. This tool is based on statistical analysis of time series, particularly something called Heteroscedasticity. How would our method solve that? The method would assess (a priori) all the processes present in the system and it could determine whether processes are active or not and in which order they are. Identifying the critical concentration, it could predict the tipping point. Also, it would not rely on statistical analyses.


Tomorrow:

-Fix Figure 1

-1st section
    Discuss the figure in the first place
    Change equations in deduction
    Change discussion about processes being active or not
    Discuss errors and orders (I don't know how)
    Clarify that you are staying on first order
    
-change X%

Other things about the introduction:
      Refine what you introduced today:
      	     Toni said it would be better to highlight simply that it is very difficult to study transient dynamics because of a number of reasons.
	     He also suggested this could be an opportunity to introduce keywords (tipping points, for instance) and references (probably new ones).

## May 24

**M** Meeting with Jenna

**M** Meeting with Toni Valles
Put review in references
Look at the code
Look at papers that cite the paper we discussed today.

## May 25
I am going to start doing some of the literature review that Toni was telling me. My goal should be to take a look at the second paper in the list and see if there are any alternative methods they show and how I could assess them within our own method.

**R** Alternative methods for transient dynamics https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsaa056

In the abstract they define regime shifts not very specifically: (periods of rapid change punctuating longer periods of lower variability)
They apply their work to fisheries.
They use regression models (statistics) applied to three quantities: among-species mean rate of change, mean per-capita rate of change, and standard deviation of percapita rate of change

In the resilience analysis section Toni writes: "In the active growth, inactive decay scenario, the phage population recovered while the bacterial population became extinct for a finite volume (Figure 5a). This was close to the stable equilibrium expected for a model without the decay term (Supplementary). The discrepancy was X\% due to the inactivation of the predation term." I do not think this is accurate, because the equilibrium analysis without
