## Monday 6

**W** I introduced corrections suggested by Toni and started fixing the tables in the supplementaries.

**R** The Physics of Climate Change

Chapter 1: discusses the example of the Mekong delta. Because of the position of the moon relative to south east Asia, it seems there is only one high tide per day in the Mekong Delta. When the tide is high it encounters the downstream of the river preventing the Sea to input salt into the river, which would be fatal for an ecosystem with high fish biodiversity, fish density and fertile enough to feed 14 million people.

Chapter 2: In 1953 Charles David Keeling goes to Big Sur to measure concentrations of CO$$_2$$ in the atmosphere. His measurements in Pasadena had not been very reliable. He measures 310 ppm during the afternoon. Later, he observes there is more CO$$_2$$ concentration during the night.
He also measures the $$^{13}C/^{12}C$$ ratio (??) and observes this ratio is smaller at night. There are more $$^{13}C$$ isotopes per $$^{12}C$$ during the day than at night.
