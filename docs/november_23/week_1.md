## Monday 6

**W** I introduced corrections suggested by Toni and started fixing the tables in the supplementaries.

**R** The Physics of Climate Change

Chapter 1: discusses the example of the Mekong delta. Because of the position of the moon relative to south east Asia, it seems there is only one high tide per day in the Mekong Delta. When the tide is high it encounters the downstream of the river preventing the Sea to input salt into the river, which would be fatal for an ecosystem with high fish biodiversity, fish density and fertile enough to feed 14 million people.

Chapter 2: In 1953 Charles David Keeling goes to Big Sur to measure concentrations of CO$$_2$$ in the atmosphere. His measurements in Pasadena had not been very reliable. He measures 310 ppm during the afternoon. Later, he observes there is more CO$$_2$$ concentration during the night.
He also measures the $$^{13}C/^{12}C$$ ratio (??) and observes this ratio is smaller at night. There are more $$^{13}C$$ isotopes per $$^{12}C$$ during the day than at night.

This difference was explaining by the respiration activity of plants, which prefer $$^{12}C$$.

In March 1958 and after collaborating with Roger Revelle and Harry Wexler, Charles David Keeling measures the atmospheric concentration of CO$$_2$$ in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. This has been done ever since.
Keeling observed changes in the concentration: increasing from November to May, decreasing from May to October. This is due to the existence of life on Earth. This is because there is more photosynthesis going on in Summer.

Seems that the slope of the Keeling curve has not changed, but Keeling himself pointed out that the ocean might be absorving part of the atmospheric CO$$_2$$ converting it into carbonic acid. From the wikipedia: "The interconversion of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid is related to the breathing cycle of animals and the acidification of natural waters."
Before keeling had taken measures, the ice layer in Greenland and the poles gave us some insight as of what had happened before. The seasonal patterns are also reflected in the ice layers, so that one can count years by drilling into the ice sheet. The ice contains bubbles of air and you can measure air composition there.
The correlation between fossil fuel consumption and the keeling curve is very clear. The values are well above the highest CO$$_2$$ concentration measured abour 350000 years ago.
The oldest continuous ice core records extend to 130,000 years in Greenland, and 800,000 years in Antarctica. I'm assuming there simply was not ice layers before that time.


**R** Fermentative Foods: Microbiology, Biochemistry, Potential Human Health Benefits and Public Health Issues

Fermentation: a biochemical process through which most microorganisms decompose carbohydrates to produce energy under anaerobic conditions

Types of fermentation:

      1. Alcohol fermentation: performed by yeasts
      2. Lactic acid fermentation (homo and heterofermentation): Lactic acid bacteria
      3. Butyric acid fermentation: Clostridium, Bacillus, and other anaerobes.
      4. Mixed acid fermentation: Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia)
      5. Propionic acid fermentation: Bacteroides and others
      6. Acetic acid fermentation: Acetobacter and others


The electron acceptors are pyruvate or acetyl CoA (acetyl coenzyme A)


## November 7

**R** Strogatz

Love affairs. A dynamical system that explores all possible combinations of stability and eigenvalues.
In the next chapter he considers two-dimensional systems.


**W** Supplementary Materials.

Conditions in which two attractors exist theoretically.
