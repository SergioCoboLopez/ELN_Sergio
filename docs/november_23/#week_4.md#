**code** and **W** - New calculation of error

### Exact error

The exact error for $$w_c=1$$ is defined as:

$$\begin{equation*}
\epsilon^1_i = \frac{\left|A_i(t_f) - A^{\mathcal{O}_1}_i (t_f)  \right|}{\Delta A^{obs}_i} \, .
\end{equation*}$$

Here, $$A_i(t_f)$$ and $$A^{\mathcal{O}_1}_i (t_f)$$ are the values of agent $$A_i$$ at time $$t_f$$ for the full and simplified model in order one, respectively. In the case of highly dynamical systems such as the one considered in this work, $$\Delta A^{obs}_i = A(t_f)$$.


$$A_i(t_f)$$

For the Lotka-Volterra system, we have the error for the bacteria ($$B$$) and phage ($$P$$):

$$\begin{equation*}
\epsilon^1_B = \frac{\left|B(t_f) - B^{\mathcal{O}_1}_i (t_f)  \right|}{\Delta B^{obs} (t_f)}
\end{equation*}$$


$$\begin{equation*}
\epsilon^1_P = \frac{\left|P(t_f) - P^{\mathcal{O}_1}_i (t_f)  \right|}{\Delta P^{obs} (t_f)}
\end{equation*}$$

How to compute the $$\epsilon^1_B$$ and $$\epsilon^1_P$$:

1. Take the final values of bacterial concentration of the simplified and full models
2. Take the absolute value of the difference between these and divide it by the value of the concentration at the final time.
3. Repeat for each scenario considered: growth-on_decay_off, growth-off_decay-on, growth-on_decay-on without tipping points ($$\epsilon_B=\epsilon_P=0$$ by definition), growth-on_decay-on with tipping points, growth-off_decay-off (first three regimes), and growth-off_decay-off (trivial regime with no process active)


### Estimated error (upper bound)

The estimated error is:

$$\begin{equation*}
\epsilon^1_i \le w_c \sum^{I}_{k=1} a_k \cdot f_k \sum_{ \{n \}_k} \frac{M^{\mathcal{O}_n}_i}{n-1} \, .
\end{equation*}$$

Here, $$k$$ indicates a regime in a dynamics and $$a_k=\frac{\Delta A^{obs}_{ik}}{\Delta A^{obs}_{i} (t_f)}$$ and $$f_k=\frac{\Delta t_k}{\Delta t^{obs}}$$. Here, $$\Delta A^{obs}_{ik}$$ indicates the maximum value of $$A_i$$ during the regime $$k$$, $$\Delta A^{obs}_{i}(t_f) = A_i (t_f)$$, and $$\Delta t_k$$ is the duration of regime $$k$$. $$w_c$$ indicates the critical value of the weights, and $$M^{\mathcal{O}_n}_i$$ is the number of processes impacting agent $$A_i$$ in order $$n$$.


In our case, the estimated errors for bacteria and phage (with $$w_c=1$$ are):

$$\begin{equation*}
\epsilon^1_B \le  \sum^{I}_{k=1} a_k \cdot f_k \sum_{ \{n \}_k} \frac{M^{\mathcal{O}_n}_B}{n-1}
\end{equation*}$$

$$\begin{equation*}
\epsilon^1_P \le  \sum^{I}_{k=1} a_k \cdot f_k \sum_{ \{n \}_k} \frac{M^{\mathcal{O}_n}_P}{n-1}
\end{equation*}$$

How to compute these errors:

1. Determine the maximum order you are interested in.

2. For every regime $$k$$ of a dynamic take:
   * $$\Delta B^{obs}_{k}$$ and $$\Delta P^{obs}_{k}$$: max value of $$B$$ and $$P$$ in $$k$$
   * $$\Delta B^{obs} = B (t_f)$$ and $$\Delta P^{obs} = P (t_f)$$
   * $$\Delta t_{k}$$: duration of regime $$k$$

3. For every process inactive in order 1, determine in which order they are active. Assume that dynamic processes do not change their order within regime $$k$$.

4. Repeat for all $$k$$ ($$I=4$$ in most cases)

**code**
How to calculate the estimated error.
I think I should start considering the growth-on, decay-off scenario. I have four regimes here.
I will start with the only growth regime.

$$\Delta B^{obs}_{k}$$ and $$\Delta P^{obs}_{k}$$ are going to be the final value of the bacteria (the largest one) and the initial value of the phage (their concentration is constant).
In any regime, I should obtain maximum values of bacteria and phage.
In any regime I should get final and initial time.
Also final values.
In principle, I should integrate the function within the code.

The actual error should be relatively easy to compute.

Now I should get the weights of inactive processes.

I need to add another argument to the concatenated error function.
This argument should be a dictionary of dictionaries:

Regime 1: {max: x, final: y, initial_time: z, final_time: z1}, Regime 2: ...
With this structure I can then extract the weights of the processes and determine in which order they are active.
I have the dictionary structurally ready. Complete it with the information missing.
Extract weights from dataframe.

**Thoughts** Come up with a system of tracking versions of figures such that you don't have to go back to previous versions.
Also come up with a system of tracking discussions or ideas so that you can remember why did you decide to do things a specific way. Then you can go back faster.

**code** I found a way to change values in a dataframe based on two conditions
