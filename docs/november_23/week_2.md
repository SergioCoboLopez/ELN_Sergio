## November 13

**R** Climate change
The first great carbon cycle:
    1. Also called the geological cycle
    2. Carbon dioxide dissolved in ocean water to form carbonic acid:
       $$CO_2$$ + $$H_20$$ $$\rightarrow$$ $$\underbrace{H_2CO_3}_{\text{carbonic acid}}$$
    3. Then the carbonic acid $$H_2CO_3$$ interacts with the ocean or the rock forming carbonates
    4. Carbonates are insoluble on water and sink to the bottom of the ocean thereby removen $$CO_2$$ from the ocean.


The subduction further removes $$CO_2$$ from the atmosphere.

**W** I updated the figure 2 and run edits and proofreads on the rest of the paper.

## November 14

The carbon cycle is self-regulated (reading the rocks). This means that if $$CO_2$$ in the atmosphere increases, more of it dissolves in the ocean. If there is a lot of carbonates in the ocean, more of it comes from volcanos that have been accumulating in the Earth mantle.
