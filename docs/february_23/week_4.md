## February 27

**(CP)** Reading the rocks

Permian-Triassic extinction
Part of it was that the ocean level dropped and reduced the habitat of marine fauna. Oxygen had disappeared from the ocean
Volcanic events in Siberia

**H** - I would like to put all the functions in my library, but I would need to use the parameters as arguments and I don't think I am ready for that yet.
I would like to print a phase diagram and decouple solving the equations from plotting. I can see it is possible to plot a phase diagram. I am not seeing completely clear the decoupling of solutions from plots.
I think some functions have to go to make the code more modular. I am scared because I might need these functions in the future. But they have been stuck at my code and not been used. Mostly, they are used to compute the times at which the full model finds the critical times.

Now that I have this, I have a more compact code. I could do a separate code for the phase diagrams. Nothing stops me from doing that, in reality.
