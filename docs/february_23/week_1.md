## February 6

CP - I was preparing the class for the classics yesterday


## February 7

VP -  I am going to re read my draft and will read the paper from Cynthia and Forest.

O - Help Jenna with problem for the Arks
This is being a more difficult problem than I expected. Right now, I am thinking I should think in terms of mass rather than in terms of volume and or concentration.
I have three elements: ocean, arks, and sample. I need to understand what is happening in the arks and then everything should go better.
Let $$V_a$$ be the volume of the arks. Let $$V_a$$ be constant, which means that water flows in and out at the same flow rate ($$v_{in}=v_{out}$$)
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d V_a}{dt} = -v_{out} + v_{in} = 0
\end{equation*}
$$
For simplicity, I am going to assume that $$v_{in}=v_{out}= 1 ml/s$$. I am going to assume also that the initial concentration of DOC in the Arks is $$C_A(t=0)=5g/ml$$ and that the concentration in the ocean is constant and
$$C_O=3g/ml$$. Now, the change of volume per se does not tell me anything, but it should tell me how the concentration and the mass of DOC changes in the arks.

## February 8

VP - I read the abstract of the paper of Cynthia and Forest. Now I am going to read my draft and decide what could be better or different:
1. Abstract - I think I should start telling what exactly I am doing. Then, I can justify why I am doing that. I have a first version ready.
The next goal will be to look at the introduction.

## Results of the week

PH - I was able to solve task a, as I show in the figure.

MS - I solved task b and got these figures that I am showing.

H - I could not finish task c, but I did subtasks c1, c2, and c3. I will do c4 next week.

O - the class was very interesting this week, I could solve my problems with SDSU HR, and sent the submission for conference c
