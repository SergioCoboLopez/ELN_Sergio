R - I read the abstract of paper X and looked at Fig. 1. It is an interisting paper for different reasons. I will read the whole paper.

R - I read chapter X of book Y.

MS - I am going to do task b starting from subtask b1.
MS - I was not able to finish subtask b1, because I have to solve an unexpected problem. I will continue tomorrow.

PV - I am going to work on the methods section of the draft and send it to Heather


## February 7

R - I kept reading paper X because it was very interesting. I think it could be a useful reference for that other paper I am writing in regards to H

PH - I worked with the task a in GoldSim. The results were a little bit disappointing because of different reasons.
