**CP** I have some questions for today's class that I want to revise, answer and send to F. I also made a short script for today's class. In the script I go through chapters XI, XII, XIII, and XIV.
In my opinion, Darwin is mostly making predictions of his theory. In Chapter XI he tries to predict the appearence of new species and the extinction of old species. He does so using the three main pillars of his theory (species appear, they take the place of old species). Darwin does not understand very well how extinction occurs, but his theory predicts it, and that's what it's important.
He appeals to the imperfection of the fossil record to explain why we don't see intermediate varieties between current and already extinct species.
He then talks about something called parallel succession: basically, where you find similar geological formations, you find similar fossil records.
That allows Darwin to introduce his next prediction of the theory: geographical distribution of species. And also how geology and migration influence it.
First, he notes that climate is not the driver of geographical distribution. Every climate region in the USA has an analog in Europe. Yet faunas are different. This happens to a larger extent in the southern hemisphere: South America, Africa, and Australia have similar climates, but different faunas. Therefore, it has to be physical barriers to migration that make the difference. Oceanic islands, for instance. Why are oceanic islands important for the theory of natural selection? Well, they are important in the personal experience of Darwin. He discovers the theory while in the Galapagos islands: he realizes that the local varieties of finches are endemic and perfectly adapted to their habitat. On the other hand, if migration is not possible, remote islands are a perfect benchmark for the theory: natural selection should have perfectly adapted species to their environments.
The Wallace line is also important. It is a biogeographical boundary where four tectonic plaques meet and differentiates the Asian and Australian faunas.
So essentially if migration is impossible, you will see species perfectly adapted to their environments. If migration is possible, you won't.

**M** Classes with Forest.

What is the hardest part of teaching? Preparing classes and impostor syndrom. It takes more than I had expected.

Best part? I learn a lot and it's very rewarding.

1. Socratic method: make questions to the students
2. Feedback from the students: talk to them to improve the class (next week). (Be positive) Questions:
   -What were your expectations for this class?
   -Are those expectations being met so far?
   -What do you like about the class?
   -And what would you fix?
   -What would you like to see in these introductions?

If they complain about canvas, we don't do it this way
Grades:
Give them back their homework plus a note with their grade out of the total possible.
Be critical and make sure you keep control of the class.

Email William again with the dates of the Omnivore's Dilemma. Send him information on the book, tell him to have the students read the book and then meet before the class.

Figure out who is in the class for the list of emails.
Send Hazy History to students.
Grade them.

**H** - Figures. What do I need for the figures?
Figure 4 - I have to plot two results in the same figure.
Then, do $$\epsilon=0.5$$ and $$\epsilon=1$$.
Then I have to be able to plot only part of the figure.

Figure 5 - Make a code with carrying capacity.

Figure 4 - I probably changed the figure size.
The most elegant way to solve this is probably to pack everything in a single function. That way, I could call the same function twice or once depending on what I want to do.

The expected outcomes from my function would be:
1.
