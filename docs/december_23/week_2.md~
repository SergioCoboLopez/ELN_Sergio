## December 15

**O** I am thinking of migrating the ELN to gitlab to have restricted access to my website to whoever works with me. It seems that Gitbook could work for this. I don't think so: it seems it cannot handle equations.
I should have a better understanding of how just-the-docs works, maybe?
Essentially, migrate my website to somewhere else where I could control accessibility.
Alternatively, I could try to do a website using markdown from scratch.

**O** Tasks

The first thing is to compute the error. For that, I need to see where the code is. And it would be helpful to fix whatever is not working with my repo.

Then, I should change the notation both in the main text and, particularly, in the supplementary materials.
I should also fix whatever is not working in the .tex file. Seems pretty bad. So:

1. Fix error in repo
2. See what the code is doing
3. Go over notes
4. Fix .tex file.
5. Check state of the manuscript in terms of equations.
