## December 20

How does this table look like?
I think rows are scenarios and columns are parameters: r, d, c, m, maybe \tau too. and tf

There is a use of \tau and \Delta t^{obs} that I don't really understand. I suppose \tau is more general than \Delta t^{obs}.

I think the most reasonable course of action after lunch would be to revert two commits back to be able to run codes and check parameters.
This would be to determine critical times and parameters.
Fix table with initial values

**code**
What could I have done to prevent this situation?

1. Periodically check if pushes are being effective (read for errors). This is the most obvious one.
2. Prevent big files from being part of the repository.
3. Do not produce big files unless required.
