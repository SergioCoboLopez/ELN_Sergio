## December 25

**W** I need to submit the paper to biorxiv. One of the problems I will face is that I need to submit the main text and the supplementary materials separately. It does not make any sense that I reference figures of the supplementary in the main text. Unless I can "talk to them" from one document to another.

The right solution would be to:

1. Label the supplementary figures as S1, S2, ... , SN.
2. Have the main text and supplementary talk to each other.

Apparently, there are ways to do this. Maybe I can split main and supplementary text. Ok, this works.
I have to check if the figures are well referenced.
