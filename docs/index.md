This is Electronic Lab Notebook using the template designed by Antoni Luque at the [Luquelab](https://www.luquelab.com). The template was based on recommendations from Noble PLoS Comp Biol 2009, Wilson et al PLoS Comp Biol 2017, and Briney "Data Management for Researchers" (2015), Hunt and Thomas "The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery" (2019 2nd ed).
The Electronic Lab Notebook has a section for each month. Each month is further divided and weeks and days, where I describe my tasks and thoughts about those tasks.

## Instructions

When a new month starts, you have to create a document called:

     name_of_month_year.md

The head of the document has to be:

    title: name_of_month_year
    nav_order: n
    has_children: true
    permalink: /docs/name_of_month_year
