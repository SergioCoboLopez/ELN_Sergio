## April 16

**W** I rewrote the third paragraph of the proposal and I am quite satisfied. I managed to put the critical words required. I will do another round tomorrow before meeting with Toni


**ANN** I will get back to the pyreen problem of creating and training artificial neural networks. I am particularly concerned about the relU thing, but I should try to get at it and build neural networks first.
I don't understand completely what training means. But this is not my goal, I think.
Seems that generating different weights is almost trivial: I just have to create ten different ANNs. However, the activation function is a different story. Can I manipulate that? Or will I need a different library. Probably the best way to do this is to do **something** and then see if it is good enough or not.
How are data generated in the first case?
I think the training generates the output data. That's probably the confusing part of the training to me. I could do that with my code and let it run at this point.
The only problem would be that I do not have any control over the transference function (so far)
I am not actually training the NN.
You need a training set to actually train the NN. That could be random numbers, because you would get random weights. What do I do next?
I created something that at least does not break. And it seems to be the output of training a NN in a random dataset. Rather than creating something more specific, I would focus now on seeing if we can play with the transfer function somehow.

**thoughts** My email is mostly written, but I think I should do something else about it.

Say that I do a presentation on synthetic fertilizers. What do I tell and what is my narrative?

My starting point would be that synthetic fertilizers are a very important invention that is underrated. Why? Because they feed around 4 billion people.
At the same time, they are a (huge) trap. Why? Let me explain.

Justus von Liebig

Haber-Bosch process. Here, I go to the omnivore's dilemma. I can talk on corn to illustrate the whole thing.

I can also go to Justus von Liebig for the phosporus.

## April 17

**thoughts** If you don't want to work you should start writing. Write anything. Sooner or later you will be writing about what you need to do that you don't want to do. And then you will narrow down what is exactly what you are avoiding. And once you have identified a specific task that you need done, it will be easier for you to start working. All I had to do to start was to include the median.

The problem was that the mean looks higher than the max value. And that hints us that something might be wrong. The hypothesis was that something could be wrong with the percentage calculations.
