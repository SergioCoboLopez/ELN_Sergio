## April 29

**PH**

The next tasks are:
 1. Add the updated figures to the text with a caption
 2. Add the relative error as a function of time to the supplementary
 3. Edit the phase diagram figure
 4. Go back to the main text


1. Error as a function of time goes to the main text and error as a function of critical threshold goes to the supplementary. This is better done in the laptop.

2. You repeat the panel of the logratio but with the relative error.

3. Tedious but doable.

4. Too broad right now.
