## April 29

**PH**

The next tasks are:
 1. Add the updated figures to the text with a caption
 2. Add the relative error as a function of time to the supplementary
 3. Edit the phase diagram figure
 4. Go back to the main text


1. Error as a function of time goes to the main text and error as a function of critical threshold goes to the supplementary. This is better done in the laptop.

2. You repeat the panel of the logratio but with the relative error.

3. Tedious but doable.

4. Too broad right now.

I've been trying to have a function to plot figures for a long time. But I don't think a function works, because there are still too many variables and parameters. Instead, the most reasonable strategy seems to be having a general code from which I can take or ignore things depending on the circumstances.


## April 30

**R** Phosphorus
Interchange of phosphorus between sahara and amazon rainforest
We waste about 80% of the phosphate for food production.

**ANN**
In my idea of making the code more modular, I will separate the results from the plotting.
