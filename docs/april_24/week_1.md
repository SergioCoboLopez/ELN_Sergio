## April 4

**PH** Errors
Go to code percapfinit.py and check standard error of the mean (std) as a percentage.

Before saving the results as dictionary and dataframe, multiply error by 100.
Then calculate std over the percentage error.
Save results into dataframe and name it differently.
Look at results (particularly for the decay)
