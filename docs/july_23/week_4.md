**M** Jenna's rehearsal

I think she knows what she wants to say, but not how to say it.

vmr as a proxy to test infections

dark reef and light reef. VMR changes between dark and light reef.

Ranking. Does she need to explain why she decided to rank vmrs?
The switch is watching the ratio of ATP to AMP.

DOC addition forces PtW. O2 addition forces KtW

Adding dissolved oxygen shifts VMR

If cells and phage grow at the same time (or lagging), that is consistent with KtW.
