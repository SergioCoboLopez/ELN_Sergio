## July 25

**M** Jenna's rehearsal

I think she knows what she wants to say, but not how to say it.

vmr as a proxy to test infections

dark reef and light reef. VMR changes between dark and light reef.

Ranking. Does she need to explain why she decided to rank vmrs?
The switch is watching the ratio of ATP to AMP.

DOC addition forces PtW. O2 addition forces KtW

Adding dissolved oxygen shifts VMR

If cells and phage grow at the same time (or lagging), that is consistent with KtW.

**M** Jenna
I talked to Jenna about how to write the modeling part of the thesis and connect it to the rest of the presentation and text. We made some progress

## July 26

**PH** Website and repo for workshop

I added descriptions of the models with snapshots from my models

**M** Short meeting with Jenna
We talked about the equations in the model

## July 27

**PH** Website and repo for workshop
I structured the Installation section of the website with children. That is, subsections: before installing, installation, installation of GoldSim Player, and after installing. This structure makes specific contents more accessible.
I started copying the children structure into the Models. Now every model can be accessed from the menu.

**code** Transient dynamics
I did a major reestructuring of the repo to make it more accessible. Also, Toni wants to build a package from the repo and I prepared the repo for him.

## July 28

**PH** Website and repo for workshop
-Corrected and finished the children structure for the models. I changed links by buttons to access the model and the videos.
-I added a citation file to the repo. That way, people that might use the repo can cite it right away. I also added a button to the website to access the citation file.
-I made some additional corrections to the repo contents: I added a diagram for the lotka-volterra model and equations with the name of the terms. I changed the names of the elements
in the GoldSim model to match those in the equations and diagrams.
-I added an introduction subsection to the model section


**code** Fix figure and add new dynamics

I will test the new dynamics that I implemented and then start fixing the figures.
This works but the simplified model is not accurate. I think it is a matter of the parameter choice. I think the decay rate is too high for the temporal scale.
