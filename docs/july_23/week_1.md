**O** Jae's paper
I did a first read of the methods section. I don't understand what they are doing, but it looks to me that I would write this section differently.

From the first sentence I get that they use a method to predict disease or health status.

I am not sure how to move on with this part of the paper...

I think I need to figure out the notation to make sure this is correct or not.

And I will probably need to read the whole paper.

This is the documentation I need for the code: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html

I think they use this logistic regression to predict how specific taxa are associated to disease/health status. Rank is also related to that. That's pretty much it, from what I can see.
