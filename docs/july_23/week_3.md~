## July 17

**R** Proofread Jaeyun's paper

Par 4 introduction
He explains the advantages of GMWII over GMWI

GMWI gets many true positives but not many true negatives (bias)

**M** Meeting with Toni

Toni wants to do stuff with colab. It seems as a universal way to have your code in the cloud.

**M** Meeting with Jenna. Rank.

Jenna ranks her communities in decreasing order of VMR. That is the rank.
When she plots that, she sees a non-linear trend.


## July 18
**R** I finished reviewing Jaeyun's paper

**code** I have corrected the code but I don't see a way to get into a dynamics where nobody is active

## July 19

**code** Airplanes
I have an adjacency matrix at t=0. How do I make a second iteration?
I think the most intelligent thing would be to manage the incoming links.

Incoming links are cornerstone.
Say that node i incomes a link (2 planes) from node j.
Take the 2 links and randomly distribute them as outgoing links.

Nodes will have a degree. The degree is given by the total number of incoming links.
Then, nodes distribute their degree among the rest of the links as outgoing links.
How do I distribute the nodes at random?
I have an in degree and 4 possible destinations
Randomly select a number between 0 and 3 (0 and N-1) in-degree times.
Add that number to the corresponding outgoing dictionary

This looks better. Make sure that the changes in the adjacency matrix are consistent.
