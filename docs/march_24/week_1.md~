## March 7

**ANN** I will have to restart the processes with a run id of 1, after switching off the computers.
In the meantime, what am I supposed to do?

The data that I am now generating starts reading data generated by ANNs with 2 input layers, 5 internal layers, and a size of 10. There is another parameter. It is the run number.
Clearly, the BMS will generate the expressions that best explain the data generated by the ANNs
