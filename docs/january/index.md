## January 2
The next thing I want to do is to change concentrations of $$O_2$$ and/or glucose at day 0 (day +2)
There are several types of elements in GoldSim that appear to be helpful.
This is confusing to me: all I need is to change the concentration of $$O_2$$ or glucose at day 2.
Then, I guess I need some element that can do these two instructions. I found how to add 
concentration, but not the timed part.
