# October

## October 2 to 7 

Goals of the week:

PHAGES Goals:
1. See how the model behaves with ecological parameter values and concentrations

3. Put actual values on coinfection model
4. Help Greg and Pete with model if needed
5. Start thinking about protists (growth rates, death rates, preying rates)

Metabolic model vs coinfection model:
See how coinfection model behaves close to the equilibrium

Transient dynamics paper:
			
Transient dynamics paper:
1. If provided, incorporate feedback for the methods section. 
2. Prepare Figure 4

## October 2
I am going to read the paper for the journal club. Questions:

1. What do they do?
They measure energy of the gut microbiome of mice

2. How do they do it?
They remove the microbiota using surgical procedures. Then they use bomb and direct calorimetry.

3. What are the results?
   a. Mice gained weight over months because they did not have microbiota intaking energy anymore.
   b. Heat dissipation changed right after removal of the cectum.
   c. 8% of total energy expenditure is due to the cectum (1% of mice's body mass)

4. Why is this important?
Because most studies in metabolic energy are based in aerobic conditions

5. How can be this relevant for my own research?
Maybe for Metabolic Theory of Ecology?


I am going to meet with Jenna in a few minutes.
My plans are to have her help me with:
-actual values of parameters and initial concentrations of bacteria, phage, and lysogens
-What does she think of O2 and sugar consumption?
-Look at how the coinfection model behaves close to the equilibrium
-Tell her to explore the montecarlo part of GoldSim. Does this work for our future models?

Jenna will start doing the montecarlo lessons of GoldSim next week. Her goal will be to run the coinfection model for many
different values of B0, P0, L0, infection rate, or burst sizes. So far, we've seen that the coinfection model is very robust
and reaches the equilibrium after less than 100 hours. Will this model behave so good for different values?
Another two things we are concerned about:
1. Is the induction rate correct?
2. Lysogens are supposed to grow slower than sensitive bacteria. Should we implement this explicitly?

Now, I am going to put values on github pages.
Then, I will think about the induction rates.
