After the normoxic event, I would expect an aerobic metabolism kicking in.
The system's thermostat is not working properly. And I don't know why. But that explains a lot of
things.

First, I have something called "Experiment Switch". This activates, as expected at 48 hours. Nothing
wrong with it.
Once it switches on, I should expect a flow of 'hose_on' water.
O2 hose is a conditional quantity. And it depends on an event (the actual thermostat).
That thermostat is inactive by default. And it never switches on.

The thermostat works. However, the O2 consumption is too low to activate it. If I reduce the bandwidth
so as to activate the thermostat nothing changes that much.
