|(O)|Fix my problems with the fellowship|

## March 21

**H** Redo code and calculations
I started fixing the repository to write the new equations with different timescales.

Make sure simplified dynamics are right. - done for r dominant
Start plotting figures adequately.
Find how the active bioprocesses should look like now. - mostly done. I ran some tests for 'r' dominant and it works.

Go for m dominant
x and yticks are a problem for unknown reasons to me.

I will have to change the functions that find changes in the dynamics.

Simplified dynamics look correct. The critical concentrations match the result in the code. Even the critical time for the first change in the dynamics does.

## March 22

I want to play now with the latex version of the model. Then I should tackle the problem of the Hill Function.
