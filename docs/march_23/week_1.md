## March 6
I focused on preparing the class and introducing some changes to the viralization paper

## March 7
I am going to work on the phase diagram. I've realized I have a few notes on my personal journal. It seems to me that the phase diagram should live on Figure 4.
I think Toni tells you to leave figures a, b, and c where they are (remember to put b and c as just b). Then, figure c, should be the phase diagram for different values of $\epsilon$ (0.1, 0.5, 1). Then, in the column you put your figure d. And figure e would be the changes in the number of mechanisms for different values of $\epsilon$. I am going to start plotting the phase diagrams for all values of epsilon. 

I am getting close and plotting the whole phase diagram for three different values of $\epsilon$.

I should worry now about aesthetics. First, think of how to show a single cycle of the dynamics. Second, how to plot critical concentration lines wihtouth making it too confusing.
Third, fix axes and ticks.

I am looking at repeated values of the initial concentration of bacteria and phage to find the value at which a single cycle occurs. But this strategy is probably flawed. I should look at when the initial values is crossed. For the critical concentration lines, I should look at the minimum, maximum values of bacteria and phage, probably.
