## June 3

**ANN** Translate the (piece of) code from the notebook to an actual python code and make sure it works. Be careful with saving files.

The code works, but it does not return the expressions. I need to recover those expressions. My assumption is that "pms" must be a class with certain attributes. I expect "pr" (or something similar) to be one of those attributes. I expect "par_values" to be another attribute.

And then I expect to get other values.

I got everything and now it's time to save things in a csv.
