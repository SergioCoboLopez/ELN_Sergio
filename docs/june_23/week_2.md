**R** Transient phenomena in ecology
This paper provides me a few convenient definitions of transient dynamics and I think they are trying to solve the same problem we are trying to solve ourselves.


**W** Presentations. I built the basics of the presentation (mostly introduction) but I need to think how to I focus the story later on.

**W** Presentations
I am having some doubts about the storyline of the presentation and I think I am trying to pack too much information for 10 minutes.
I think my message for this presentation should be the method rathen the results. I should envision it as: General method-Lotka-Volterra model-method applied to Lotka-Volterra-Results. Why do this?
