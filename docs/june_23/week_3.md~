## June 12

**R** Transient phenomena in ecology
This paper provides me a few convenient definitions of transient dynamics and I think they are trying to solve the same problem we are trying to solve ourselves.


**W** Presentations. I built the basics of the presentation (mostly introduction) but I need to think how to I focus the story later on.

## June 13

**W** Presentations
I am having some doubts about the storyline of the presentation and I think I am trying to pack too much information for 10 minutes.
I think my message for this presentation should be the method rathen the results. I should envision it as: General method-Lotka-Volterra model-method applied to Lotka-Volterra-Results. Why do this?

## June 14
**M** Group meeting was succesful and interesting
Forest was surprised no one had done this before. Maybe another round of literature research could help?

The GoldSim model does not work. Maybe induction rate is the key?

I solved major issues with the presentation and did some practices. Looking good.


## June 15
**m** Meeting with Forest about GoldSim
It seems that the current modeling approach is not working toward our desired goal. What would be alternative approaches for mechanistic models in the future?
Biology still does not have a system of units. It rather has metrics.
Is genetic information a universal quantity that could be used as a unit of biological information?
How to solve the problem of scales in Biology?

**W**
I read corrections of text by Toni and I incorporated to the oriinal source file. I need to read again and correct if needed.
I fixed Figure 1 for the subsampling paper.
I fixed the phase diagram cartoon of the percapfinit paper

Later today:
**W**
Do some rehearsal of presentation and decide what needs to be fixed
Re read Toni's corrections

Fix the equations and put zero where corresponding.
Fix the figure and do piecewise versions of it.
Put equations for tipping points.

## June 16

**M** Presentation with Toni
1st slide - figure of the presentation. Maybe remove first slide?
Example of the dynamics: Figure 1a
1st example of the dynamics: finite time (tau) and observable change (per capita).
Make F1 flat (not very relevant)
Highlight F2
Eq 3,4,6

Poner tu paper "in preparation"

Another narrative is why you don't have a center in the Lotka-Volterra.
Resilience analysis: it is missing.
He suggests resilience analysis for r active m-inactive and r and m active

Mention that the paper is in preparation

Not necessary to put values of parameters.

Figure phase diagrams:
Reduce font
Add diagrams.

To do today:
 remove first slide
 Switch formalism by figure 1a
 Remove parameter values
 Change Fig diagrams.
