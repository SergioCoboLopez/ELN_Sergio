I am preparing goals and work of the week.
Solving a problem with github pages and latex syntax. Problem solved.
Forest wants me to prepare a presentation and protocol for next Monday. I already set up the structure
of the presentation and prepared a first draft of the protocol. I will take a look at it by 
the end of the week.
I did a couple of lessons of GoldSim courses.
Tomorrow: take a look at figure for paper, read abstract of paper for Journal Club, talk to Lucas, 
do a couple of lessons of GoldSim. If there is time, look at draft for conference.

## November 29
Talk to Lucas about presentation for Monday


## November 30
I talked to Forest, Lucas, and Andres about my model. I got a better idea on how to proceed
I redid my model
I realized the goldilocks line is in C6H12/6O2=0.937 because of the stoichiometry. I need to develop
on that and put it on my goals.
I need to think about the Hill function tomorrow.
I also need to work on my draft tomorrow for at least an hour.
