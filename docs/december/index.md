# Decemeber

## November 28 to December 02

Goals of the week

-Check documentation of GoldSim repository
-Finish fermentation and test that everything works correctly
-Finish stochastic unit in GoldSim
-Writing on draft
-Draft of ESA application

Reading

Journal club
Microbial Metabolism on book


## November 28
I am preparing goals and work of the week.
Solving a problem with github pages and latex syntax. Problem solved.
Forest wants me to prepare a presentation and protocol for next Monday. I already set up the structure
of the presentation and prepared a first draft of the protocol. I will take a look at it by 
the end of the week.
I did a couple of lessons of GoldSim courses.
Tomorrow: take a look at figure for paper, read abstract of paper for Journal Club, talk to Lucas, 
do a couple of lessons of GoldSim. If there is time, look at draft for conference.

## November 29
Talk to Lucas about presentation for Monday


## November 30
I talked to Forest, Lucas, and Andres about my model. I got a better idea on how to proceed
I redid my model
I realized the goldilocks line is in C6H12/6O2=0.937 because of the stoichiometry. I need to develop
on that and put it on my goals.
I need to think about the Hill function tomorrow.
I also need to work on my draft tomorrow for at least an hour.

## December 1
I sent out the protocol for the presentation next Monday and a few slides on how GoldSim works.
I am going to start working on the paper now. First, I want to have a decent draft of Figure 4.
I finished a first draft on Figure 4. There is something odd with the lines that mark the transitions between simplified dynamics.
This had already happened before, but I do not remember what exactly the problem was. I will check this at other time.

## December 12 to December 17

Goals of the week

-Update documentation of GoldSim. Draft of ESA application
-GoldSim code: Finish fermentation and test that everything works correctly
-Viralization paper
-Transients dynamics paper
-Code for error

Reading

Journal club
Go over Transients dynamic paper again - start becoming an expert on it
Microbial Metabolism on book


## December 12
There are enzyme inducers: some are competitive (they occupy the place of substrates) and some are non-competitive. Non competitive (or allosteric, apparently) attach to a different part of the enzyme. These inhibitors are involved in feedback loops to deactivate the enzymes.

Group meeting:
In the world of the bacteria, diffussion is the main force for nutrient flow.
"Win" stands for "winogradsky"

There is an error with github pages in the goldsim repository and I don't know how to fix it. I suspect it is related to having a draft paper in the docs folder. However, this is not a problem in the needle finder repository, and that is puzzling me.

## December 26 to December 30

Goals of the week

-Figure out what I have to do for:
1. Seminar on Jan 12
2. Presentation on Jan 6
3. Model for Presentation on Jan 6 (GoldSim)

Reading

I have been trying to repair the model for Lucas and Andres' experiment.
I have lumped together bacteria, lysogens, and infected bacteria.
Then, I added stochasticity to the infection rate, the decay rate, growth rate, and induction rate (in that order)
For most values, I have maximum and minimum values, but I don't know how to estimate the standard deviation (I should look into that tomorrow)
I did not do anything about the probability of lysogeny (at least I should assess the problem)

Tomorrow, I should:
1. Set the goal of the experiment with the expected outcomes (put in the goals)
2. Explain what I did with numbers and references (put it in the goals)
3. Extract results for each stochastized parameter separately
4. Put all together
5. Think about the statistics (sigma)
6. Assess the probability of lysogeny problem
