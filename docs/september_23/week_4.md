**O** Emails
I wrote a short bio and sent it to Dave Lipson

**M** Seminar of ecology

This went relatively well. I could see some people were confused, but I think I managed to show the main idea of the transient dynamics.
I got many questions

**R** Tipping points

I believe our system (or our way to look at it) is an open system, because input change over time and so does the formalism.

I think the terminology is not very centralized here.

B-tipping points: associated to bifurcations.
N-tipping points: associated to noise.

Both of them are important for sudden climate change.

They propose a new type of tipping point. R-tipping.
Here, a sufficiently raped change to an input or parameter causes the system to tip from an attractor.
This is not exactly what we are seeing: we are seeing that the dynamics of the system tip the system. However, it is closer.
R-tipping points need not to be associated to noise or bifurcations (??). This is where we get closest to them, because we do not see bifurcations, either. That is, there is no new equilibrium position, that we are aware of. (Not completely sure about this)

I think bifurcations are associated with changes in parameter values.

They discuss all three types in global energy balance model of the climate system.

Climate tipping points are discussed to be of internal or external (changes in orbital patterns) origin.

First attempts point to a fast-slow dynamics: weather is fast, climate is slow.
The weather acts as a random force perturbing the climate.
Weather induces noise-induced tipping points.

Sutera: 10^5 years for random transitions between warm and cold climate states.

Power spectral analysis. Periodicity is an open question.

Noise-induced escape from attractors

Attractor selection: noise and parameter changes.

Bifurcation-driven tipping points.
lambda(t) is time dependent in that it can switches on an off. However, it is more that bifurcations are induced by the own dynamics.
If lambda is constant you have a paremetrized system and lambda is a quasi-static attractor.

He mentions again two timescale systems. He mentions statistical analysis and correlations of fluctuations.

Stochastically forced system:
 They have a brownian motion term
 safe bifurcations: an attracting state loses stability but is replacied by another nearby attractor.
 Explosive bifurcation: attractor dynamics explores more of phase space but returns close to the old attractor.
 Dangerous bifurcations: attractor after and before bifurcation are different.

QSE: Quasi-static equilibrium. Separation of timescales

I don't understand the separation of timescales, but it might resonate with what we are doing.

The paper is going to discuss the rate-dependent tipping. And they are going to use a simple model.

**R** Tipping points, Ashwin

Figure 1 shows a high dimensional open system: dependent variables are x,y, and chi(t) (those are probably parameters that change over time). x is a subsystem of y. It is forced by observables (??). You can understant x by examining the system b. Maybe this is compatible with having mechanisms active/inactive.

closed systems: autonomous, finite-dimensional, deterministic systems.
open systems: have inputs that can change the fate of system trajectories

drift; instantaneous lag

If the drift is constant, the system has a steady drift.

For an R-tipping point to occur, this natural time scale may be comparable to the slowest time scale.

how far the linearized system needs to be from a branch of Quasi-Static Equilibrium (QSE) to ensure that the non-linear system tips.

This paper is much more technical than I had expected.

Three examples of R-tipping basend on Saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation
Third example is based on fast-slow systems.

I don't understand very well the two lines A and B.

Critical rate rc

I don't understand the first example, honestly.

The second example does not look great either. It is a Hopf bifurcation. From what I've learned, Hopf bifurcations arise when you have complex conjugate eigenvalues crossing the plane over the imaginary axis.

There is a frequency w.
There is steady drift and unsteady drift.

**R** Review about lambda phage

I was reading the sections about the experimental advances historically

**W** Journal club
I put what I got from the review into the journal club presentation. I focused on the timeline and make some notes on it.
