## September 4

**code** Airplanes.
I think I need two distinct adjacency matrices. One for outgoing links, one for incoming links. They are different processes.
I think not. I think the adjacency matrix is perfectly consistent this way. Columns represent where nodes travel to. Rows represent how links receive nodes.

I fixed the second iteration. Tomorrow I should check that it works.
