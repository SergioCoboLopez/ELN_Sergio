**R** A paper from Jason's literature review

The model estimates mean annual biomass, production, and consumption for components of an ecosystem.
The ecosystem needs to be partitioned into groups of similar species.

I think this is another dynamical approach; it just focus on different types of "biomasses".

Nt: number of animals
wt: mean individual weight at time t.
Zi: instantaneous total mortality

**W** Rewrite the new formulation of the per-capita equations

Tomorrow:

Finish the derivation of equations.
