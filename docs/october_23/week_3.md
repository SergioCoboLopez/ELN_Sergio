## October 16

**R** A paper from Jason's literature review

The model estimates mean annual biomass, production, and consumption for components of an ecosystem.
The ecosystem needs to be partitioned into groups of similar species.

I think this is another dynamical approach; it just focus on different types of "biomasses".

Nt: number of animals
wt: mean individual weight at time t.
Zi: instantaneous total mortality

**W** Rewrite the new formulation of the per-capita equations

Tomorrow:

Finish the derivation of equations.


## October 17

**W**
I introduced several corrections suggested by Heather. Some of them require more thinking, but I will take care of that later.

I derived the equations for the per-capita rationale


## October 18

**R** Daysyworld model

The mathematical formulation of the daysyworld model consists of two ODE's:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d \alpha_w}{dt} &=& A - B \\
\frac{d \alpha_b}{dt} &=& A - B
\end{eqnarray}$$
