## October 23

**O**
I checked and redid stability calculations on the percapfinit paper and found some weird things that I need to double check.

## October 24

**O**
I did most of the paperwork for the catalan qualification agency

**M** Corey Taylor and Joan Roughgarden

I do not think I can be very helpful to Corey with what I have been doing in terms of Lotka-Volterra. How can I help him?

Lotka-Volterra puts all the predation dynamics in a mass-dependent term. And that term does not assume anything about what the actual dynamics of the system are.


## October 25

**W** Suggestions provided by Heather and things to take into consideration:

1. Attractors and stability: I made a mistake, because many eigenvalues are zero and one cannot guarantee stability.

2. We have two different errors: the theoretical error and the relative error. How do we assess those?

   The theoretical error is the absolute value of the inactive processes of a dynamic integrated (summed) over time.
   The relative error takes the full dynamics minus the simplified dynamics, which actually yields the inactive terms. We then divide the inactive terms by the full dynamics and average the error of bacteria and phage

3. Is the per capita part of the analysis clear?

4. Two last sentences of the abstract.

5. Change title of figs 3a, 4a, 5a.

6. Colab

## October 26

**M** Meeting with Toni

    1. Send Toni what you got from the colab work.
    Add paper I am using
    Readme file

    2. Change table of stability analysis
    You need to argue that it does not make sense to calculate the equilibrium under certain circumstances. For instance, when the the growth is the only process that is active, $$B*=0$$ does not make any sense.
