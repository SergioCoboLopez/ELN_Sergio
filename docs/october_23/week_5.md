## October 30

**R** Paper: Warming effects on marine microbial food web processes: how far can we go when it comes to predictions?

The paper studies the effect of global warming on the microbial marine life.
The results show that temperature increases Bacterial respiration, bacterial losses due to grazers, and bacterial-grazer biomass flux.
Warming also increases Bacterial production.


## October 31

**PH** I went back to the GoldSim metabolic machine modeling and realized there were a few errors that I corrected. I am a little bit hesitant about the respiration power, but I at least have a source now.

## November 1

**W** I finished the table of dynamics now. I just need to correct it into latex form and add the text. I think I can do that tomorrow and now correct the figure of the supplementary.
