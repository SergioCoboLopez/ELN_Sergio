## January 8

I will have to test all indices of the publications and then sort them cronologically.
This has been taken care of.

Now I need to think about the paper again. And I really don't want to do that, but I'd better start at some point.

**O** Error of FOMAD

The error will have to be kept below a threshold.

**R** https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.032307
This paper models SBMs for multilayer networks: one with nodes as units, the other one with links as units.

**O** Error of FOMAD

I am a little bit confused/skeptical about one of the steps in the derivation. In reality, there is no reason to be confused. Given the rule that:

$$\begin{equation*}
\frac{w_{c}}{n} \leq |w^{\mathcal{O}_n}_{ij}| < \frac{w_{c}}{n-1}
\end{equation*}$$

The substitution in the equation makes total sense. Only that I should include a $$<$$ symbol.
