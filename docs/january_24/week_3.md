**R** Review tipping elements.

Once again, the term "tipping elements is consistent through the literature. In this paper they are defined as components of the Earth that could undergo state shifts (qualitative changes in their behavior). These state shifts would be caused by modest levels of additional forcing that exceed critical thresholds or tipping points.

Examples of tipping elements: ecosystem changes, shifts in frequency or intensity of extreme events, or atmospheric release of large carbon stocks.

Different tipping elements seem to have crossed their tipping points in the past. Stability of ice sheets and ocean circulation systems. I've found two papers on that subject.

Different types of tipping elements/points according to Ashwin's paper.

Tipping elements themselves are extremely complex.

They selected 10 tipping elements based on the following criteria:

a. Active debate
b. High potential impact
c. Particularly intense debate (??)

There is another paper citing a model.

Tipping elements 
1. Slowdown or Collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).
Warm saline water moves northward in the upper ocean by the Gulf Stream.
The waters become dense because they loss buoyancy and sink once they hit a critical threshold.
AMOC could be bistable. "on" and "off" states.

As the twin factors of temperature and salinity play key roles in the buoyancy loss process responsible for driving the overturning circulation, warming and freshening of surface waters may inhibit
the sinking process that drives NADW formation from taking place. 
You need temperatures to be stable so that water sinks down?


**W** RyC
I drafted a summary of something I am not sure whether it is my CV or trajectory. And I have 400 characters left.
I think I should do the whole documents and then present a summary.

SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CONTRIBUTIONS 

    1. Unconventional superconductivity
    2. Complex systems and statistical models
    3. Models for ecology and biology and mechanistic models
    4. Closing the circle: how statistical and mechanistic models complement each other. Case study: ecology and tipping elements in the Earth System


INTERNATIONALIZATION AND MOBILITY

Germany, Korea, USA 1 and USA 2

INDEPENDENCE AND LEADERSHIP

PhD mentoring and postdoc mentoring.

LINE OF RESEARCH TO BE DEVELOPED 

How mechanistic and statistical models can complement each other to develop better knowledge of ecology (??) and climate science.

There are four sections and 10 pages to work with. I think 2 pages per section and an additional page for the line of research to be developed would be reasonable.


**W** More supplementary materials

There needs to be a way of simplifying the notation. First, we had all active processes on orders higher $$n>1$$. Now we want to refine over orders. So for every order of magnitude you count all
processes being active on that specific order. That is the new meaning of that sum.

I think I found a good solution to the notation problem. I can let an index run over $$M^{\mathcal{O}_n}_i$$ processes that are active on order $$n$$. I need to go over this tomorrow again. Probably first thing in the morning is the best way.
