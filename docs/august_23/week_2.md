## August 14

## August 15

**M** I met with Forest and we discussed how to get the GoldSim model into a Forest. I think it's feasable, although it will probably need some corrections

**W** I finished a basic version of the figure with Toni, but I am thinking of other alternatives. I might not draw them explicitly but think about them.

**code** I introduced a google analytics tag to track visits to the workshop website. I changed the acknoledgments to start converting it more into a GoldSim tutorial website.

I should think tomorrow more explicitly about how to use the percapfinit for the bacterial growth project. In the meantime I will review the text of the manuscript. I should
also check the colab website too.
