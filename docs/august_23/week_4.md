## August 28

**O** I've found a practical way to automate the coding of the ELN with the command sed. I will probably be able to develop a script to build all the files of a month.
Then maybe I can thing of the next step, of course.

**W** Transient dynamics draft
I got to the resilience part. I think what Toni wants to say here is: we have analyzed how the system responds to perturbations and what we see is consistent with our formalism. I am not happy with the changes I've introduced. The discussion is going to be worse.

In any case, the resilience part is telling you the following: from the point of view of traditional stability analysis our model works, because it predicts the equilibrium concentrations of a model without the decay term. If you see a discrepancy is because there is another term that it's not active.

**W** Cover letter

I am not happy with what it looks like. Right now is just a description and that's why it is not spectacular enough.

**W** Transient dynamics

I don't really like the discussion section. The sentences are very complex and long, and they miss the point of whatever they are trying to tell. I am going to try to distill what every paragraph says.

Paragraph 1

Only the active processes within a finite timescale determine the dynamics of the system.

Paragraph 2

Change of paradigm

Paragraph 3


How do I think this should be organized? I think it should go from general to specific, to general again.
I think the first paragraph should describe what the main message of the paper is. To me, the main message is that PerCapFiniT is a tool to predict tipping points and transient dynamics.

Suggestions Toni

Paragraph 1

More insight than summary of the paper.

Paragraph 2

Caveats and limitation (simplified model)

Paragraph 3

-More general again. Grab Scheffer's language (and/or others) and describe you method from that point of view. Early warning signals.

-Mention colab

-Where do we understand the tipping points in contrast with other approaches.
Taking scheffer's language (early warning signals). We see things differently: tipping points are activation of new terms with new attractors.

We add the idea of attractors.

Toni does not think the limitation is the statistical analysis.

What is the rule of critical transitions? The rule is that new mechanisms become active, and new attractors arise. Early warning signals.

Make sure I cite everyone important.

Mention that you could do signal analysis.


## August 31

**W** Biomath talk.

I have thought of repeating the math introduction and show the phase diagram panel.

**code**

I have fixed some errors with the website and I tried adding a favicon that shows up in the browser. Not very succesful yet.

**O** Outline for seminar ecology

I don't know very well how to deal with this. I know it should be orbiting around modeling and GoldSim.

I think I could start telling that I am a physicist. And how are physicists useful to ecology?
