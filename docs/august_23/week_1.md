## August 7 to 13

**O** ESA Conference

This was a very interesting conference.

My workshop went well. I had six people coming. Although it was not a lot of people, it was enough for me to be able to help them and check on them to see if they had any problem. We went through three models and I think they understood the basics of everything.
The website and the repository were very helpful for me and for them, as well.

I attended a few talks on transient dynamics and models. My general impressions is still that there is no clear definition of what transient dynamics are. I have not seen a definition that can be universal. I attended another talk about a model making the carrying capacity a function of the biomass. That was very interesting.
